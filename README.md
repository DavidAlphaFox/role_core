RoleCore
====

RoleCore is a Rails engine which could provide essential industry of Role-based access control.

It's only provides the ability to define permissions and pre-made Role model.

In addition, it's not handle the authentication or authorization,
you should integrate with CanCanCan, Pundit or other solutions by yourself.

## Installation

Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'role_core'
```

Then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Copy migrations

```sh
$ bin/rails role_core:install:migrations
```

Then do migrate

```sh
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

Run config generator

```sh
$ bin/rails g role_core:config
```

Run model generator

```sh
$ bin/rails g role_core:model
```

## Getting Start

### Define permissions

Permissions are defined in `config/initializers/role_core.rb`,
checking it to know how to define permissions.

In addition, there also includes a directive about how to integrate with CanCanCan.

### Hook application

In order to obtain maximum customizability, you need to hooking up role(s) to your user model by yourself.

#### User who has single role

##### Create `one-to-many` relationship between Role and User

Generate `one-to-many` migration, adding `role_id` to `User` model

```sh
$ bin/rails g migration AddRoleToUsers role:references
```

Then do migrate

```sh
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

Declare `a User belongs to a Role` association

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :role

  # ...
end
```

Declare `a Role has many Users` association

```ruby
class Role < RoleCore::Role
  has_many :users
end
```

##### Check permission

Permissions you've defined will translate to a virtual model (a Class which implemented ActiveModel interface),
`permission` would be an attribute, `group` would be a nested virtual model (like ActiveRecord's `has_one` association).

So you can simply check permission like:

```ruby
user.role.permissions.read_public?
user.role.permissions.project.read? # `project` is a `group`
```

For better usage, you may delegate the `permissions` from `Role` model to `User`:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :role

  delegate :permissions, to: :role

  # ...
end
```

Then you can

```ruby
user.permissions.read_public?
user.permissions.project.read?
```

_Keep in mind: fetching `role` will made a SQL query, you may need eager loading to avoid N+1 problem in some cases._

#### User who has multiple roles

##### Create `many-to-many` relationship between Role and User

Generate a `many-to-many` intervening model

```sh
$ bin/rails g model RoleAssignment user:references role:references
```

Then do migrate

```sh
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

Declare `a User has many Roles through RoleAssignments` association

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :role_assignments, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :roles, through: :role_assignments

  # ...
end
```

Declare `a Role has many Users through RoleAssignments` association

```ruby
class Role < RoleCore::Role
  has_many :role_assignments, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :users, through: :role_assignments
end
```

##### Check permission

Permissions you've defined will translate to a virtual model (a Class which implemented ActiveModel interface),
`permission` would be an attribute, `group` would be a nested virtual model (like ActiveRecord's `has_one` association).

So you can simply check permission like:

```ruby
user.roles.any? { |role| role.permissions.read_public? }
user.roles.any? { |role| role.permissions.project.read? } # `project` is a `group`
```

For better usage, you could declare a `can?` helper method:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :role_assignments, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :roles, through: :role_assignments

  def can?(&block)
    roles.map(&:permissions).any?(&block)
  end

  # ...
end
```

Then you can

```ruby
user.can? { |permissions| permissions.read_public? }
user.can? { |permissions| permissions.project.read? }
```

_Keep in mind: fetching `roles` will made a SQL query, you may need eager loading to avoid N+1 problem in some cases._

### Integrate with CanCanCan

Open `config/initializers/role_core.rb`, uncomment CanCanCan integration codes and follows samples to define permissions for CanCanCan

Open your User model:

- For a user who has single role:

  Add a delegate to User model:

  ```ruby
  delegate :permitted_permissions, to: :role
  ```

- For a user who has multiple roles:

  Add a `permitted_permissions` public method to User model:

  ```ruby
  def permitted_permissions
    roles.map(&:permitted_permissions).reduce(RoleCore::ComputedPermissions.new, &:concat)
  end
  ```

Open `app/models/ability.rb`, add `user.permitted_permissions.call(self, user)` to `initialize` method.

You can check RoleCore's Demo (see below) for better understanding.

### Management UI

See [RolesController in dummy app](https://github.com/rails-engine/role_core/blob/master/test/dummy/app/controllers/roles_controller.rb)
and relates [view](https://github.com/rails-engine/role_core/blob/master/test/dummy/app/views/roles/_form.html.erb) for details.

## Demo

The dummy app shows a simple multiple roles with CanCanCan integration including a management UI.

Clone the repository.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rails-engine/role_core.git
```

Change directory

```sh
$ cd role_core
```
